“We put the complicated stuff inside so you can have simple stuff outside.”

Description: We have created a radio that is as easy to use as an old table radio with only a volume knob and a channel selector knob. Inside is a computer which provides a “granddaughter mode” allowing a user or helper to change the contents of the channels. This github repository holds the code for our granddaughter mode, allowing them to change which radio station stream they want to correspond to the channel on the knobs. 

Languages: Javascript, HTML, CSS, PHP
