“We put the complicated stuff inside so you can have simple stuff outside.”

Description: We have created a radio that is as easy to use as an old table radio with only a volume knob and a channel selector knob. Inside is a computer which provides a “granddaughter mode” allowing a user or helper to change the contents of the channels. This github repository holds the code for our granddaughter mode, allowing them to change which radio station stream they want to correspond to the channel on the knobs. 

Instructions: To start, click on the link to our server. It will take you to our welcome page. You must login to enter the site. The username and password is set as a string. You will receive an error message if you enter it incorrectly.

After you click login/enter, it will bring you to our streamplayer page. This page shows what radio station is currently set to your channel knobs. There are 8 channels, numbered and labeled respectfully on the top of the page. You can click the play button to play music directly from this webpage. You can even change the channel from this webpage by entering the channel number you want to change, use the scroll down bar to select a new station and then click "change". You will see the page update with the new stream. If you want these changes saved to our server, you can click "save" and it will push it to the raspberry pi. 

If you want more information on the radio stations you can select from, we have created a "search" button. This will redirect you to a new page with a search bar and a display of all the radio stations we have available. You can search for a specific station, whether by name, location or genre. The page will update based on the input you put in. If you want to sample the music before deciding to change your channel, all you have to do is click on the image icon and it will open up another tab and start playing. You can simply exit this tab when you are through listening. To push this station onto the channel is similar to the previous page. This time, you hit "select" under the station you want, scroll up to enter the channel you want to change and click "save". That's it! You can change the stations whenever you want by accessing our granddaughter site.
